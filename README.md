### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* After connecting the cells from main story to the cells file, I did not rename the Class which caused the app to not function well until I located and fixed the error.

* Being able to access the content within the URL properly. Specifically the posterView.

* A lot of the syntax was new so needed to become familiar in order to get it to do what I intended.
